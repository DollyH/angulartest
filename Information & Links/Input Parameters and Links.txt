Questions

***** Please fill-in the points mentioned as discuss or any changes you think should be done by evening 7 *****

	* For question 1, layout will be as in demo
	The options will cover all the sub-points specified in doc like regulatory requirements, security, mission-critical, tightly coupled, etc.
	For manual installation, there will be a checkbox as in demo(All Yes/No questions will be in same format)
1.	What is the type of your application?(Choose any 1)
	a) Personal Productivity
	b) Dependent on other services
	c) Little/No dependency on other services
	d) B2B/B2C
	e) Heavy Computing
	f) Mission Critical
	g) Service/Regulatory
	
	
	?? Discuss and fill in the options
2. How many users will access the application at a given time?(Choose any 1)


3. What is the life-cycle status of your application?
	a) Early - Incremental dev/test 
	b) Stable - Application fully developed 
	c) Near to closure - Will be used for a short period of time

	
4. Let's discuss the external dependencies for your application
	a) Are you using any licensed products? Yes/ No
	b) Mention if any particular operating system is required? Textbox
	c) Mention if any particular database is required? Textbox
	d) Does your application deal with multiple databases? Yes/No
	
	
	?? Discuss and fill in options for b)
5.	Let's discuss some technical aspects!
	a) Type of resources required: Shared/Dedicated
	b) Estimated storage requirements(Choose any 1)
	c) Session management required: Yes/No
	d) Any specific network architecture used like fixed IP hosting: Yes/No
	e) Is parallel processing required: Yes/No
	f) Does the application use local file system? Yes/No
	
	
	?? Discuss and fill in options for a)
6. We're almost done! One major aspect remaining: COST
	a) What is your budget? (Choose any 1)
	b) Is geographical availability required? Yes/No


1) Which would most accurately describe the domain of your application? (List)
2) What is your location? (List)
3) What is your budget? (Radio)
4) What are you estimated storage requirements? (Radio)
5) What level of Security would you require for your application? (Radio)
6) Expected number of user of the application? (Radio)
7) Preferred type of architecture? (Radio)

Note: most radio options will have associated description that will enable easier understanding of the requirements. Ex: hybrid, private cloud - briefly what are they

1)	Type of Application. This will provide:
  a)	Security – clouds that offer security protocols, etc.
  b)	Domain / sector of the application, suitable for which deployment structure (public , private, hybrid)
    i)	Credit card information can’t be on public etc.
    ii)	Regulatory issues – Banking, government, etc
  c)	Mission-critical
  d)	Is tightly coupled architecture required? (Not suitable for cloud). Preferable - service oriented architecture
  e)	Is manual installation of application required?
2)	How many users will access the application at a time? (Capacity and Frequency of Use)
3)	Life-Cycle status
4)	Frequency of change (continuous development or integration)
5)	External dependencies
  a)	Open source or licensed – restrictions applicable for scalability and extra costs
  b)	OS, DBs, LDAP /etc. If accessing multiple databases, latency will occur – cloud not recommended
6)	Resources being used by the application (Tech perspective)
  1.	Sharing resources or not
  2.	Load balancing?
  3.	Providing dedicated resources? 
  4.	Memory for each instance
  5.	Hardware resources / scalability – CPU usage 
  6.	Network architecture – fixed IP hosting and routing for dynamic mgmt
  7.	Session state-> then paas not iaas
  8.	Parallel processing/scalability ? y/n
  9.	Does the application use local file system? If yes, then that can be a problem
7)	Cost  / investible / savings – request handling
  a)	Capacity 
  b)	Mobility – geographical availability
  c)	Application architecture / topology
